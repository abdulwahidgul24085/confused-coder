Hi, my name is Abdulwahid Gul aka Wahid. I have a master's degree in Big data from the Queen Mary University of London. I also have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science. I am very curious about computers in general. My area of intrest and expertise are in Data Science and Web Development. I am mostly interested in modern tools for the modern-day developer.

I spend most of my time trying to find the right tool for the right job. I am a firm believer in the 80/20 rule. I try my best to understand and learn the 20% of the skills that can help me achieve that 80% of the work. I know it is not easy to identify which 20% I need to focus on. But with time I am getting better in identifying that 20%. If I have to jump deep into a particular topic and add additional skills I don't mind learning them.

I focus on the best possible action needed for a business or an idea I am working on. I do not stick with a tool because I am bias to it. I try to get the right tool for the right job. I know selecting the tools is not as straight forward. But I make sure I progress forward and achieving the desired outcome, in the most efficient manner possible.

I like to write about web development and data science from my experience and perspective. Sharing what I learn along my journey of this endless sea of computer science knowledge.
