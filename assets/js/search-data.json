            "title": "Enter the World of Docker",
            "content": "Introduction . The idea of having an isolated environment is nothing new. To keep your computer clear of all clutter is produced by installing programming language, framework, and databases. This is something you worry about when you have passed the beginning of your programming journey. There have been always been solutions for you to achieve this, in the modern programming paradigm. But as programming evolves and get’s better. So does the tool to help you write programs get better as well. . World before Docker . In the past, we had solutions that would introduce a completely virtual environment. This will be an isolated OS on your system with its operating system, fixed and expendable resources. This was a viable solution, and it is still used in some case studies these days. But most of us don’t need such a resource hugging solution. Anyone that has run something like Virtualbox or similar solution would know what I mean. We also had solutions like vagrant. But they also had their problems of being efficient you can read up more on them on the internet. I personally had worked with Virtualbox and found it much easier to work with than Vagrant. But I might have had been a younger develop back than. But that should speak volumes for its developer-friendly nature. . World with Docker . Enter Docker. So how has the world changed? Docker allows its users to the underline kernel of the OS and just isolate the parts of the application that is unique. This greatly reduces the resources intensive nature of virtualization, with some additional perks. You can mimic your development environment without worrying about the machine you are developing on. It also lets you pass around your environment with your team and they can start off with a similar environment instantaneously. It is also helpful for getting your junior and new recruits without letting them worry about setup. . What is Docker? . Docker is exactly like a virtual environment but what is so powerful about it, as compared to a VirtualBox solution. It lets you use the kernel of your base operating system. Since you already have it installed. Then why should you waste resources by reinstalling it? It has some key terminologies, learning it would help you search on your journey when you will be learning it. . Images | Containers | Volumes | Networks | Images . This is the core of your application. Just like when you are deploying an application to a server. You have to get hosting from AWS, or Azure. You select your VM (virtual machine), and select a Linux flavor. If it is a Linux server? (Docker works with windows based images as well.) Then you install all of your required programming languages and tools (databases, queueing system, etc.). An image is that isolation in Docker. You can backup your VM and spin-up other VMs with it. The same concept applies to images in docker. You can use an image to create multiple containers. An image in Docker can be ubuntu, fedora, or alpine based. I will talk more about my choice of Linux version Alpine more later in this article. . Containers . Following along the same analogy of VMs. When you have the VM configured and installed all of your application dependency. Know that code of your application has to be pulled in to the VM and some configuration has to be made of it to run on the VM. This running of your application is equal to a container in the Docker universe. What Docker lets you do it encapsulate your code into the container. . Volume . When you run a container all of your application’s state is stored in the container. If you remove your container all the files in that container will be removed. What this means is that, if your application has uploaded images or files while the container you will lose them. Also, when you have a database running as a container, all of your databases active will be removed with the container. This is scary. But don’t worry. Docker lets you mount a folder on to your system inside the container. What it does, it that it saves, all of your disk activity on to your system. Know if you remove the container, or even the image, is safe and sound. When you recreate the container you can carry on from where you have left off. Pretty cool right? . Networks . Since Docker is its own light computer running inside your VM or the local machine. It maps its ports for communication to the outside world. When I say it does that, I mean you have to do it. It is part of the Docker configuration process. You can create a network within Docker that will help your container communicate on a shared resource machine(that is everything running on the same machine). You can also create an overlay network in docker that spans over multiple machines. . Docker and its files . So how does the alchemy of the Docker voodoo work? Well, it is quite simple if you understand the key points of Docker, and what they are. Since the docker entire creation process is working with config files. You don’t need programming for the most part of working with docker. Two key config files that you work are defined as follows. . Dockerfile . A file name Dockerfile with no extension is where you create the image. refer to the Image heading. You can have a different name. The Dockerfile is just the default format. If you choose to have a different name, you need to specify the filename when you are running the Docker commands. . Docker-compose . Everything in Docker is an individual image. Databases, programming language, frameworks, etc. They function independently. If you want to run multiple images an example would be python running on alpine Linux base image, using Django as the web backend framework, Postgres, or MySql as a primary database, Redis as a caching database, and job scheduler. You can define all of them in the docker-compose.yml file. The format of this file YML or YMAL. It does not matter which extension you use. Whatever you specify in the docker-compose file will be on the same network. You don’t need to link them manually. But if you choose for it to be part of a predefined network. Or let other containers connect with the resources created by a docker-compose file you can do that within the docker-compose file. . Always remember to use the internal ports when you have created a connection. Since all of them are on the same network. You can use the service name instead of an IP as your host. This will help you in case if you recreate a container, the IP will be taken care of by Docker. . Conclusion . In future posts, I will talk in-depth on how to work with each aspect of the Docker environment. I will dedicate a post for each of the main ideas in the Docker environment.

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . #collapse-hide import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . #collapse-show cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . .

I am very curious about computers in general. My area of intrest and expertise are in Data Science and Web Development. I am mostly interested in modern tools for the modern-day developer. . I spend most of my time trying to find the right tool for the right job. I am a firm believer in the 80/20 rule. I try my best to understand and learn the 20% of the skills that can help me achieve that 80% of the work. I know it is not easy to identify which 20% I need to focus on. But with time I am getting better in identifying that 20%. If I have to jump deep into a particular topic and add additional skills I don’t mind learning them. . I focus on the best possible action needed for a business or an idea I am working on. I do not stick with a tool because I am bias to it. I try to get the right tool for the right job. I know selecting the tools is not as straight forward. But I make sure I progress forward and achieving the desired outcome, in the most efficient manner possible. . I like to write about web development and data science from my experience and perspective. Sharing what I learn along my journey of this endless sea of computer science knowledge.
